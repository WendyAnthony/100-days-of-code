**Today's Progress**: 
- trying to get iNaturalist to work in R ```library("rinat")```
**Thoughts:**

**Today's Progress**:

- Learning more about .md styling 
  - e.g. Table of Contents, list items
- trying ```eBird auk``` [auk](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/auk/vignettes/auk.html) package

**Thoughts:** 
- using examples from packages work fine (e.g auk), but when trying to import real data, not so much ...
